                                        <p class="mt-2">
                                            Freemasonry is the world's oldest and largest Fraternity. Its history and
                                            tradition date to antiquity. Its singular purpose is to make good men
                                            better. Its bonds of friendship, compassion, and brotherly love have
                                            survived even the most divisive political, military and religious conflicts
                                            through the centuries.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Freemasonry is neither a forum nor a place for worship. Instead, it is a
                                            friend of all religions which are based on the belief in one God.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Freemasons are respectable citizens who are taught to conform to the moral
                                            laws of society and to abide by the laws of the government under which they
                                            live.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            They are men of charity and good works. They remain unchallenged as the
                                            "world's greatest philanthropy".<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Only individuals believed to be of the finest character are favorably
                                            considered for membership. Every applicant must advocate his belief in the
                                            existence of a Supreme Being (atheists are not accepted into the
                                            Fraternity).<br>
                                            <br>
                                            In most Masonic Jurisdictions, one must ask a Masonic friend to recommend
                                            him for membership. He must sign a petition, stating his age, occupation and
                                            place of residence. Members of the Lodge vote by secret ballot, which, in
                                            most Jurisdictions, must be unanimous.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The candidate receives three Masonic Degrees, concluding with the Third (or
                                            Master Mason's) Degree.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The Degrees are solemn, enlightening and an enjoyable experience with no
                                            uncomfortable or embarrassing moments. It is here where the principles of
                                            Freemasonry are taught and where the new member learns that his family and
                                            his own necessary vocations are to be considered above Freemasonry.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Every Master Mason is welcomed as a "Brother" in any of the thousands of
                                            Regular Masonic Lodges throughout the world.<br>

                                            No one. Each Grand Lodge has its own jurisdiction and is the supreme
                                            authority within that jurisdiction.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Obviously, many Grand Lodges have regular communication with each other, but
                                            official policy in one has no effect in another.<br>

                                            associated with being a Mason?</h2>
                                        <p class="mt-2">
                                            Yes. Like all organizations, Lodges must be able to pay their light bills.
                                            Typically, there is a one-time fee for the three degrees of Masonry, as well
                                            as regular annual dues. But these vary widely depending on the number of
                                            members, cost of living (rent in Manhattan is higher than it is in rural
                                            Oklahoma), the actual physical facilities of the Lodge, etc. The fees and
                                            dues, however, are not prohibitively expensive (the author is a college
                                            student and has no problem with them). Rather than give a single figure
                                            which may be very different than your local Lodge charges, or publishing an
                                            extended table of costs, it is easiest to simply refer the interested to
                                            their local Lodge.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Incidentally, many Grand Lodge jurisdictions provide for "life membership"
                                            after a Mason has paid dues for a long period. For example, in Michigan a
                                            Mason is no longer asked to pay dues after he has been a Mason for forty
                                            years. Other jurisdictions allow members to pay a lump sum for life
                                            membership. As with almost everything in Masonry, check with your local
                                            Grand Lodge or Lodge for more information.<br>

                                            a Masonic funeral if he or his family requests it. Such a request should be
                                            made to the Master of his Lodge who will make the necessary arrangements
                                            with the family, the mortuary, and the minister. A service is authorized by
                                            the jurisdiction in which you are located, and consists of participation at
                                            the mortuary, the beginning at the mortuary and the closing at the

                                            No. In fact, most Masons believe that to trade with a Brother Mason only
                                            because he is a Mason is unmasonic. Even more importantly, anyone who
                                            attempts to join a Lodge solely for business reasons will not be given a
                                            petition.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Masons, however, are friends, and it is not surprising that many Masons do
                                            trade with Brothers. For one thing, they are dealing with people that are of
                                            good character and can be trusted, which is no small statement in the modern
                                            marketplace.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            But Masonry is not a "place to network". Yes, some men do view one of the
                                            benefits of membership as an additional source of customers or partners, but
                                            few would say that is the only reason they became Masons. The work involved
                                            in the degrees alone would make this a poor investment - better to join the
                                            Rotary Club or other business group.<br>

                                            society?</h2>
                                        <p class="mt-2">
                                            No. Secret societies are generally defined as organizations which are
                                            unknown to the public and whose existence is denied. The Bavarian Illuminati
                                            and the Mafia would be examples of secret societies.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Masonry, on the other hand, is well-known and proudly displays its
                                            existence. Masonic Temples are clearly marked as such, and many Lodges are
                                            listed in the yellow pages (usually under "Fraternal Orders"). Members often
                                            wear rings or tie-clips that identify themselves as Masons, and Masons often
                                            participate in community charity work. Finally, some Masonic functions are
                                            open to the public.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Masonry is not a secret society, but rather a society with a few secrets.
                                            These are mainly modes of recognition - the signals, grips, signs, and
                                            phrases by which Masons recognize each other. The actual degree rituals are
                                            considered secret as well, not because there is anything that would harm
                                            Masonry by their revelation, but rather because they are more meaningful if
                                            the candidate does not know what is going to go on during them beforehand.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            It should be pointed out that many other organizations have a similar class
                                            of secrets. College fraternities (a.k.a. "Greek letter organizations") often
                                            have small secrets known only to their members, allowing them to travel from
                                            house to house and still be known.<br>

                                            "Masonry is not a religion by the definitions most people use. Religion, as
                                            the term is commonly used, implies several things: a plan for salvation or
                                            path by which one reaches the after-life; a theology which attempts to
                                            describe the nature of God; and the description of ways or practices by
                                            which a man or woman may seek to communicate with God. Masonry does none of
                                            those things. We offer no plan of salvation. With the exception of saying
                                            that He is a loving Father who desires only good for His children, we make
                                            no effort to describe the nature of God. And while we open and close our
                                            meetings with prayer, and we teach that no man should ever begin any
                                            important undertaking without first seeking the guidance of God, we never
                                            tell a man how he should pray or for what he should pray. Instead, we tell
                                            him that he must find the answers to these great questions in his own faith,
                                            in his church or synagogue or other house of worship. We urge men not to
                                            neglect their spiritual development and to be faithful in the practice of
                                            their religion. As the Grand Lodge of England wrote in Freemasonry and
                                            Religion, 'Freemasonry is far from indifferent to religion. Without
                                            interfering in religious practice, it expects each member to follow his own
                                            faith, and to place above all other duties his duty to God by whatever name
                                            He is known.' Masonry itself makes only a simple religious demand on a man -
                                            he must believe that he has an immortal soul and he must believe in God. No
                                            atheist can be a Mason." - Dr. Jim Tresner, 33rd degree<br>
                                            <br>
                                            "Freemasonry has no dogma or theology. It teaches that it is important for
                                            every man to have a religion of his choice and to be faithful to it. A good
                                            Mason is made even more faithful to the tenets of his faith by membership."

                                            Nothing could be further from the truth. The rituals (degrees) are designed
                                            to reinforce virtues that the Craft finds desirable, such as Justice,
                                            Brotherly Love, Truth, and the like. The rituals are actually quite
                                            beautiful and filled with ancient language and much symbolism. At no point,
                                            however, is the candidate asked to do anything that would embarrass or
                                            demean him, nor anything that would violate his obligations to his faith,
                                            country, or the law.<br>

                                        <p class="mt-2">
                                            The only religious requirement is that candidates believe in the Supreme
                                            Being. If you can in good faith profess a belief in the Supreme Being, you
                                            are eligible to be a Mason. No atheists will ever knowingly be made a Mason.<br>

                                            There are Christian (Catholic, Protestant, Mormon), Jewish, and Muslim
                                            Masons. It would be tedious and pointless to go into a religion-by-religion
                                            (and then denomination-by-denomination) discussion. The key points to
                                            remember are the requirement of belief in the Supreme Being and the fact
                                            that Masonry is a fraternity, not a religion.<br>

                                            Some men are surprised that no one has ever asked them to become a Mason.
                                            They may even feel that the Masons in their town don't think they are "good
                                            enough" to join. But it doesn't work that way. For hundreds of years, Masons
                                            have been forbidden to ask others to join the fraternity. We can talk to
                                            friends about Masonry. We can tell them about what Masonry does. We can tell
                                            them why we enjoy it. But we can't ask, much less pressure, anyone to join.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            There's a good reason for that. It isn't that we're trying to be exclusive.
                                            But becoming a Mason is a very serious thing. Joining Masonry is making a
                                            permanent life commitment to live in certain ways. We've listed most of them
                                            above -- to live with honor and integrity, to be willing to share with and
                                            care about others, to trust each other, and to place ultimate trust in God.
                                            No one should be "talked into" making such a decision.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Masons are prohibited from actively recruiting or asking non-Masons to join
                                            the fraternity, to insure that candidates come of their own free will.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            As with many things Masonic, there are some exceptions to this rule. Some
                                            Grand Lodges allow solicitation, provided it is low-key and with the strict
                                            provision that no pressure be applied.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Note: The Grand Lodge of Indiana allows low-key solicitation. Still, you
                                            don't need to be invited in any jurisdiction, and if you're interested, act.<br>

                                            The person who wants to join Masonry must be a man (it's a fraternity),
                                            sound in body and mind, who believes in God, is at least the minimum age
                                            required by Masonry in his state, and has a good reputation. (Incidentally,
                                            the "sound in body" requirement -- which comes from the stonemasons of the
                                            Middle Ages -- doesn't mean that a physically challenged man cannot be a
                                            Mason; many are).<br>

                                            Those are the only "formal" requirements. But there are others, not so
                                            formal. He should believe in helping others. He should believe there is more
                                            to life than pleasure and money. He should be willing to respect the
                                            opinions of others. And he should want to grow and develop as a human being.<br>

                                            If you know a Mason, ask him about membership. He will be glad to tell you
                                            all about the Craft and the local lodge, and give you a petition if you wish
                                            to join.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            If you do not know a Mason, drop a letter to the local lodge, and one of the
                                            officers will call you (or call the lodge, though you may not get an answer
                                            unless someone is actually there).<br>

                                            Typically, the process is as follows:<br>

                                            The applicant fills out a petition. The petition asks for two sponsors,
                                            though if you meet and talk with the officers, they can usually find
                                            sponsors or act as sponsors themselves if you do not know anyone in the
                                            lodge.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The petition is read at the lodge during the next business meeting, which
                                            for many lodges is during the first week of the month. A committee is formed
                                            to investigate the candidate. The petition also asks for two character
                                            references.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            The committee meets with the candidate to answer questions, ascertain that
                                            he meets the criteria for membership, and find out a little about him. This
                                            is not a "grilling session," but rather a friendly and casual chat to make
                                            certain that the candidate has been properly informed about Masonry and was
                                            not improperly solicited. The committee also contacts the character
                                            references listed on the petition (typically asking if they know any reason
                                            why the candidate should not be accepted, etc.)<br>

                                            The committee reports back to the lodge during the next business meeting and
                                            the candidate is voted on. If accepted, someone from the lodge (often the
                                            Secretary) contacts the candidate and informs him that he has been accepted
                                            and schedules a date for the Entered Apprentice degree.<br>

                                            A fascinating question! And, alas, impossible to answer within the confines
                                            of this FAQ. There are a number of theories, a lot of debate, and a lot of
                                            musty history books. Some of the books listed in question 15 of this section
                                            should be of help. As a very brief overview, here is part of an essay by
                                            Henry C. Clausen, a noted Masonic author. This is, of course, just one point
                                            of view - many other theories exist, but Clausen nicely covers the basics:<br>

                                            "Our Masonic antiquity is demonstrated by a so-called Regius Manuscript
                                            written around the year 1390, when King Richard II reigned in England, a
                                            century before Columbus. It was part of the King's Library that George II
                                            presented to the British Museum in 1757. Rediscovered by James O. Halliwell,
                                            a non-Mason, and rebound in its present form in 1838, it consists of 794
                                            lines of rhymed English verse and claims there was an introduction of
                                            Masonry into England during the reign of Athelstan, who ascended the throne
                                            in A.D. 925. It sets forth regulations for the Society, fifteen articles and
                                            fifteen points and rules of behavior at church, teaching duties to God and
                                            Church and Country, and inculcating brotherhood. While the real roots of
                                            Masonry are lost in faraway mists, these items show that our recorded
                                            history goes back well over 600 years."<br>

                                            his name does appear on several lists. Hopefully, someone will be able to

                                            William Howard Taft was made a Mason At Sight by the Grand Master of Ohio
                                            and later raised to Grand Master of Ohio in 1909.<br>

                                            Lyndon Johnson was an Entered Apprentice, but never progressed beyond that

                                            Ronald Reagan is not a craft Mason. He was made an honorary 33rd degree
                                            Mason by the Southern Jurisdiction of the AASR and an honorary member of the
                                            Imperial Council of the Shrine, but he was never entered, passed, and raised
                                            as a Mason, nor was he ever made a Mason at sight. (Source: Robinson's Born

                                            Many other leaders in government have been Masons: "They have included

                                            majority of the Justices of the United States Supreme Court, of the
                                            Governors of States, of the members of the Senate, and a large percentage of
                                            the Congressmen. Five Chief Justices of the United States were Masons and
                                            two were Grand Masters. The five were Oliver Ellsworth, John Marshall (also
                                            Grand Master of Masons in Virginia), William Howard Taft, Frederick M.
