                                <p class="mt-2">The newly chartered Newburgh Lodge No. 174 F&AM was located in downtown Newburgh. The
                                    Lodge address was <strong>8 State Street, Newburgh, IN</strong>. In the beginning, all Lodge
                                    meetings were held on the second floor of the building, while the first floor was leased as a Drug
                                    store. When the Druggist relocated, the Lodge expanded and remodeled the first floor to serve as
                                    their dining room.</p>
                                <p class="mt-2">After more than 100 years, plans were made to build a new lodge building that would be
                                    up to date with building code changes and further from the river.</p>

                                <p class="mt-2">On April 21, 1962, Indiana Grand Lodge Officers performed the ritual of laying the new
                                    lodge building's cornerstone. That building is our present location at <strong>720 Filmore St.,
                                        Newburgh, IN</strong>.</p>
                                <p class="mt-2">Years later, the building at 8 State St. had a fire and burned to the ground. Today it
                                    is a parking lot.</p>

                                <p class="mt-2">Through good times and hard times, our Lodge survived while our Country was dealing with
                                    issues like cultural changes, ten major wars, and economic busts including the Great Depression. To
                                    this day, we are a successful Lodge and rank in the upper half of Lodges in membership in the State
                                    of Indiana.</p>
